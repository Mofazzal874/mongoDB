**Note:** MongoDB will create a data directory if it doesnâ€™t exist. You don't need to include the data directory in this repository. It is included in the .gitignore file.

- Then define the default routes in the index.js file 
- Then make the routes in the routeHandler folder


**ODM part:**
- Make all the required schemas in the schema folder for the design of the collection in the database.
- Then make model based on the schema.(Here , after designing the schema , both the schema and model object are in the todoHandler route file)
```
The naming convention for model is to use the first letter of the model name in capital letter.
```


**Note:**
- The schema is the design of the collection in the database.
- The model is the object that is used to interact with the database.
- The model is created based on the schema.
- The model is used to perform CRUD operations on the database.


**CRUD operations:**
- Create
- Read
- Update
- Delete
